Keep an eye on the appliance when heating food in a plastic or
paper container using the microwave mode. It could combust
spontaneously.
In case of smoke, switch off the appliance and remove the plug
from the socket. Keep the door closed to smother the flames.
Do not overcook food.
Do not use the inside of the appliance as storage space. Do not
store any biscuits, bread, etc. in the appliance.
Remove metal closing strips and metal grips of paper or plastic
containers/bags before placing them in the appliance.
Always install the appliance in accordance with the instructions.
Eggs in their shells and hard-boiled eggs should not be heated
using the microwave mode, as they could explode. Even after
the appliance has been switched off.
Never clean the appliance with a high pressure cleaner or
steam cleaner.
Do not place accessories of the appliance on the opened door.
Never cover the oven bottom with aluminium foil. Aluminium
foil stops the heat and may therefore lead to poor baking
results. Moreover, the email of the oven bottom could get
damaged.
The oven has a fan that cools the oven mantle. When the oven
is switched off, this fan could continue to run for some time.
The contents of baby bottles and jars of baby food should be
stirred or shaken prior to consumption. Check the temperature
to prevent burns.
Caution: Heating liquids could result in explosive boiling
over of the liquid. Also after the appliance has been switched
off. Be careful when removing the cup or container from the
appliance. Therefore, always place a plastic or ceramic spoon
in the cup when heating.
This appliance may only be fitted by a certified installer.
Defective parts may only be replaced by original parts. Only for
those parts will the manufacturer be able to guarantee that
they meet the safety requirements.
Damage as a result of incorrect connection, incorrect fitting or
incorrect use does not fall under the warranty.
If the connecting cable is damaged, it may only be replaced by
the manufacturer, its service organisation or similarly qualified
persons, in order to prevent hazardous situations.
The electrical connection must meet national and local regulations.
English 21
The socket and plug must always be within reach.
The appliance may not be connected to the mains supply
via a power strip or extension cord. If this is not observed,
the safety of the appliance cannot be guaranteed.
The appliance must always be earthed.

damaged, or if the appliance no longer functions properly or if it
is damaged in any other way. If this is the case, consult the shop
or our technical service. Never replace the plug or cord yourself.
Only use and store the appliance indoors.
Do not use the appliance near water, a damp basement/garage
or near a swimming pool.
Avoid contact with hot surfaces when the appliance is
switched on. The inside becomes hot! Never cover the ventilation holes.
Never bend the power cord sharply or allow it to run across
hot parts.
Not keeping the appliance clean could lead to wear and tear
which, in its turn, will have an effect on the life span and could
result in dangerous situations.
The appliance cannot be used with a timer or separate remote
control.
Only connect the appliance to alternate current, to an earthed
wall socket, with a mains voltage that corresponds with the
information provided on the information plate of the appliance.
Do not leave the appliance unsupervised if the appliance is
operational.
Do not pull the cord and/or appliance to remove the plug from the
wall socket. Never touch the appliance with wet or moist hands.
If you decide not to use the appliance any more due to a
defect, we recommend cutting off the cord after removing
the plug from the wall socket. Take the appliance to the waste
processing department concerned of your municipality.
If the appliance does not function after it has been switched on,
it is possible that the fuse or earth leakage circuit breaker has
been activated in the electrical distribution box. The group can
be overloaded or an earth leakage current may have occurred.
Never submerge the appliance, cord or plug in water.

12. Troubleshooting
  Problem
   Cause
   Solution
  The product does not turn on.
  The power plug is not properly connected to the power outlet.
 Disconnect the power plug from the power outlet and plug it back in after 10 seconds.
 The fuse or the circuit breaker have been tripped.
   Consult an electrician.
   The power outlet does not work properly.
 Plug a different device into the power outlet. If this device does not turn on, consult an electrician.
 No heating function.
   The door is not properly closed.
   Close the door fully.
   Noise when the glass tray rotates.
  The tray roller and the cooking chamber floor are dirty.
  Clean the tray roller and the cooking chamber floor.
   The following are normal and not signs of malfunction:
Interference with TV reception when the product is in operation.
Slightly dimmed cooking chamber illumination when the product is operated at a low power level.
Steam builds on the door.
Hot air exits the ventilation openings.
13. Maintenance and cleaning
Apart from regular cleaning, this product does not require maintenance.
Turn off the product and disconnect it from the power outlet before cleaning.
Cleaning the product is an important aspect of handling the product safely and prevents health hazards.
Clean the product and remove all food residue regularly. Failure to clean the product regularly may cause damage to the surfaces and shorten the product's service life. This also prevents a risk of impairing the product's safety and functionality.
If the door seal no longer closes properly due to food residue build-up, microwave radiation may exit the product and harm your health.
Clean the product after use to prevent mold, attracting vermin and the escape of microwave radiation.
Do not use a steam cleaner to clean the product. The steam is under pressure and may condense on electrical components on the device interior, causing short-circuiting.
Do not use any strong or abrasive solvents or sharp metal scrapers as such products attack the surface and may cause the glass to crack.
The rotary controls must not get wet. Clean the rotary controls with a soft, damp cloth only.
Clean the housing with a slightly damp cloth. Do not let any water enter the device interior.
 31

Use a damp cloth to clean the door, window, door seal, cooking chamber and all adjacent components.
Use a soft cloth to wipe away any steam or drops that may build. Condensation may occur when moist air comes into contact with a cold surface. Oil and grease also evaporate at high temperatures, before depositing as a greasy film on surfaces after cooling.
The glass tray may be removed for cleaning. Clean the tray in warm soapy water or in a dishwasher.
The tray roller and the cooking chamber floor should be cleaned regularly to prevent excessive noise. Use a mild cleaning agent to wipe down the surface.
If you have removed the roller for cleaning, make sure to replace it correctly before further use.
Disposal
Electronic devices are recyclable waste and must not be disposed of in the household waste.
At the end of its service life, dispose of the product in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines.
You thus fulfill your statutory obligations and contribute to the protection of the environment.
